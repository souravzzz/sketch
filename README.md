sketch
======

Sketch is a probabilisitc data structure that maintains counts from a stream.

I will add the properties and mathematics behind this later on.

sketch.cpp contains the class for the data structure.

runthru.cpp does a run through (duh) - you will be able to see how the data structure behaves at each step.

demo.cpp will give you a good idea about its accuracy.
